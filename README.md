An Algebraic, Executable Ur Machine.

See [Nock](http://urbit.org).

To run the code, use LuaJIT. `rep "[noun]"` will run a string. 

Note that due to recent changes to the automaton, relating to the representation of truth,
the demonstration machine will not give accurate results. 

For details, see the [specification](./ax\ spec.md) and [commentary](comment.md)
